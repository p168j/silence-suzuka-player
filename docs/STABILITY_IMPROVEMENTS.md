# Housekeeping/Stability Improvements

## Overview

This document outlines the housekeeping and stability improvements implemented in the Silence Suzuka Player to address playlist expansion stability, undo consistency, and clean shutdown functionality.

## Improvements Implemented

### 1. Playlist Expansion Stability

**Problem**: The original `_get_tree_expansion_state()` method had duplicate implementations and lacked robust error handling, leading to potential crashes when Qt objects were deleted or tree widgets were in invalid states.

**Solution**: 
- **Removed duplicate method implementations**
- **Enhanced error handling** with Qt object validity checks
- **Added graceful fallback mechanisms** for invalid or deleted C++ objects
- **Implemented per-item error handling** during tree iteration
- **Added partial state recovery** on errors

**Benefits**:
- Prevents crashes from deleted Qt objects
- Maintains expansion state even when individual items fail
- Provides better debugging information through logging

### 2. Undo Consistency Improvements

**Problem**: The undo system lacked proper error handling and could leave the application in an inconsistent state if undo operations failed.

**Solution**:

#### Enhanced `_perform_undo()` method:
- **Atomic operation handling**: Pop operations before processing to prevent duplicates
- **State backup and rollback**: Create backups before undo operations and restore on failure
- **Improved error recovery**: Better exception handling with operation restoration
- **Enhanced user feedback**: Clear status messages for success/failure

#### Updated all undo methods to return success status:
- `_undo_delete_items()`: Added data validation and deep copying
- `_undo_add_items()`: Improved index validation and error recovery
- `_undo_delete_group()`: Enhanced data structure validation
- `_undo_clear_playlist()`: Added playlist data validation
- `_undo_move_items()`: Improved state restoration
- `_undo_load_playlist()`: Added comprehensive validation

**Benefits**:
- Guaranteed consistent application state after undo operations
- Better error recovery and user feedback
- Reduced risk of data corruption during undo operations

### 3. Clean Shutdown Enhancements

**Problem**: The original shutdown process lacked proper timeout handling and comprehensive resource cleanup, potentially leaving background threads running or data unsaved.

**Solution**:

#### Enhanced `closeEvent()` method:
- **Structured shutdown sequence** with progress logging
- **Timeout-based thread termination** (3 seconds graceful, then force terminate)
- **Comprehensive resource cleanup** for media player, UI components, and threads
- **Enhanced error handling** and logging throughout the process

#### Added signal handlers:
- **SIGINT/SIGTERM handling** for graceful shutdown on system signals
- **Proper QApplication quit integration**

**Benefits**:
- Ensures all background threads are properly stopped
- Prevents data loss during application exit
- Provides clear feedback during shutdown process
- Handles system-level termination requests gracefully

### 4. Additional Stability Improvements

#### Enhanced `_group_effective_key()` method:
- **Qt object validity checking** to prevent access to deleted objects
- **Improved string validation** and edge case handling
- **Graceful degradation** when items are deleted during processing
- **Enhanced error logging** and recovery mechanisms

**Benefits**:
- Prevents crashes from Qt object lifecycle issues
- Better handling of edge cases in group key resolution
- Improved debugging capabilities

## Technical Implementation Details

### Error Handling Patterns

1. **Qt Object Validity Checks**:
   ```python
   try:
       _ = self.playlist_tree.topLevelItemCount()
   except RuntimeError:
       logger.warning("playlist_tree C++ object deleted")
       return state
   ```

2. **Graceful Resource Cleanup**:
   ```python
   for thread_name, thread_obj in threads_to_stop:
       if thread_obj.wait(shutdown_timeout):
           print(f"âœ“ {thread_name} stopped gracefully")
       else:
           thread_obj.terminate()
   ```

3. **State Backup and Recovery**:
   ```python
   current_playlist_backup = [item.copy() for item in self.playlist]
   # ... perform operation ...
   if not success:
       self.playlist = current_playlist_backup
   ```

### Logging Improvements

- Added structured logging with clear prefixes (`[SHUTDOWN]`, `[UNDO]`)
- Improved error messages with context information
- Added success/failure indicators for better debugging

## Compatibility

All improvements maintain backward compatibility:
- No changes to public API methods
- Existing functionality preserved
- Enhanced error handling is additive only
- Configuration and data formats unchanged

## Testing

The improvements have been validated through:
- Syntax validation using Python AST parsing
- Function definition verification
- Improvement marker presence checks
- Module structure validation

## Future Considerations

These improvements provide a solid foundation for:
- Further error handling enhancements
- Performance optimizations
- Additional stability features
- Better user experience improvements

The modular nature of the improvements allows for easy extension and maintenance without affecting core functionality.
